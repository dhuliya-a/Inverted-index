The 1975 are an English pop rock band from Manchester,[2] consisting of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Matthew "Matty" Healy,[3] lead guitarist Adam Hann, bassist Ross MacDonald, and drummer George Daniel.[4] Their choice of name was inspired by a Jack Kerouac beat poetry book.[1]

The band's origins trace to their attendance at Wilmslow High School in Cheshire and playing together as teenagers in 2002.[5] Gigs organised by a council worker led the band to formally sign with Dirty Hit and Polydor Records. The band opened for several major acts and released a series of extended plays (Facedown, Sex, Music for Cars, IV) throughout 2012 before releasing their self-titled debut album (2013), which included the popular singles "Sex", "Chocolate", and "Robbers", to a positive reception, reaching number one in the United Kingdom.

Their second album, I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it (2016), reached number one in the US and UK and received further acclaim from critics. Following the touring cycle for the record, the band announced their third album under the working title of Music for Cars, before going on hiatus again throughout 2017.

Returning in 2018, the band announced that the album had evolved into their third campaign cycle, consisting of their third and fourth studio albums. The first, A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships (2018), was released to critical praise, and became their third number one album in the UK. The second, Notes on a Conditional Form (2019), is due for release in May.
